    "Python and many other programming languages provide a unified way to process elements of a container value sequentially, called an `iterator`. An `iterator` is an object that provides sequential access to values, one by one.\n",

    "The iterator abstraction has two components: a mechanism for retrieving the next element in the sequence being processed and a mechanism for signaling that the end of the sequence has been reached and no further elements remain. For any container, such as a list or range, an iterator can be obtained by calling the built-in iter function. The contents of the iterator can be accessed by calling the built-in next function."

    "The usefulness of iterators is derived from the fact that the underlying series of data for an iterator may not be represented explicitly in memory. An iterator provides a mechanism for considering each of a series of values in turn, but all of those elements do not need to be stored simultaneously. Instead, when the next element is requested from an iterator, that element may be computed on demand instead of being retrieved from an existing memory source.\n",

    "Ranges are able to compute the elements of a sequence lazily because the sequence represented is uniform, and any element is easy to compute from the starting and ending bounds of the range. Iterators allow for lazy generation of a much broader class of underlying sequential datasets, because they do not need to provide access to arbitrary elements of the underlying series. Instead, iterators are only required to compute the next element of the series, in order, each time another element is requested. While not as flexible as accessing arbitrary elements of a sequence (called random access), sequential access to sequential data is often sufficient for data processing applications.\n",
