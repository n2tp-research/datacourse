    "Data abstraction is a powerful concept in computer science that allows programmers to treat code as objects --- for example, car objects, chair objects, people objects, etc. That way, programmers don't have to worry about **how** code is implemented --- they just have to know **what** it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction mimics how we think about the world. For example, when you want to drive a car, you don't need to know how the engine was built or what kind of material the tires are made of. You just have to know how to turn the wheel and press the gas pedal.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract data type consists of two types of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructors: functions that build the abstract data type.\n",
    "- Selectors: functions that retrieve information from the data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we have an abstract data type called `city`. This `city` object will hold the `city`'s name, and its latitude and longitude. To create a city object, you'd use a constructor like\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "city = make_city(name, lat, lon)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract the information of a `city` object, you would use the selectors like\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "get_name(city)\n",
    "get_lat(city)\n",
    "get_lon(city)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is how we would use the make_city constructor to create a city object to represent Berkeley and the selectors to access its information.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> berkeley = make_city('Berkeley', 122, 37)\n",
    ">>> get_name(berkeley)\n",
    "'Berkeley'\n",
    ">>> get_lat(berkeley)\n",
    "122\n",

Recall that the distance between two coordinate pairs, `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` can be found by calculating the `sqrt` of `(x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2`.
