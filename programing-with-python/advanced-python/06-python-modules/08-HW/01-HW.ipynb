    "Hopefully before reading this you‚Äôve gone ahead and attempted to figure out this puzzle all on your own, but if you‚Äôve gotten stuck, here are the steps you should take. If you are still stuck after reading this guide, please look at the solutions video or notebook.\n",

    "- Step 1: There is a .zip file called unzip_me_for_instructions.zip. Use the shutil library to unzip this file.\n",
    "- Step 2: After unzipping the file from step 1, open and read the ‚Äúinstructions.txt file‚Äù.\n",
    "- Step 3: After reading the instructions, you should realize you are looking for a phone number, so use regex to figure out a pattern that will find a phone number in a string.\n",
    "- Step 4: In order to apply this regex to multiple text files , create a function that takes in a file and your regex pattern, opens the file, searches for your pattern, and returns back any match.\n",
    "- Step 5: Use the os module to walk through all the folders and files and apply your function to each file.\n",
    "- Step 6: After running through the files, you should have gotten the phone number result 719-266-2837. Keep in mind, we put some random numbers not correctly formatted in some of the .txt files, to make sure your regex expression was looking for the correct formatting.\n",
