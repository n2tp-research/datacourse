    "# Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method for organizing programs that brings together many of the ideas introduced in this chapter. Like the functions in data abstraction, classes create abstraction barriers between the use and implementation of data. Like dispatch dictionaries, objects respond to behavioral requests. Like mutable data structures, objects have local state that is not directly accessible from the global environment. The Python object system provides convenient syntax to promote the use of these techniques for organizing programs. Much of this syntax is shared among other object-oriented programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object system offers more than just convenience. It enables a new metaphor for designing programs in which several independent agents interact within the computer. Each object bundles together local state and behavior in a way that abstracts the complexity of both. Objects communicate with each other, and useful results are computed as a consequence of their interaction. Not only do objects pass messages, they also share behavior among other objects of the same type and inherit characteristics from related types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paradigm of object-oriented programming has its own vocabulary that supports the object metaphor. We have seen that an object is a data value that has methods and attributes, accessible via dot notation. Every object also has a type, called its class. To create new types of data, we implement new classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Objects and Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A class serves as a template for all objects whose type is that class. Every object is an instance of some particular class. The objects we have used so far all have built-in classes, but new user-defined classes can be created as well. A class definition specifies the attributes and methods shared among objects of that class. We will introduce the class statement by revisiting the example of a bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "When introducing local state, we saw that bank accounts are naturally modeled as mutable values that have a `balance`. A bank account object should have a `withdraw` method that updates the account balance and returns the requested amount, if it is available. To complete the abstraction: a bank account should be able to return its current `balance`, return the name of the account `holder`, and an amount for `deposit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `Account` class allows us to create multiple instances of bank accounts. The act of creating a new object instance is known as instantiating the class. The syntax in Python for instantiating a class is identical to the syntax of calling a function. In this case, we call Account with the argument 'Kirk', the account holder's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = Account('Kirk')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An **attribute** of an object is a name-value pair associated with the object, which is accessible via dot notation. The attributes specific to a particular object, as opposed to all objects of a class, are called **instance attributes**. Each Account has its own `balance` and account `holder` name, which are examples of instance attributes. In the broader programming community, instance attributes may also be called **fields, properties, or instance variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a.holder\n",
    "'Kirk'\n",
    ">>> a.balance\n",
    "0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions that operate on the object or perform object-specific computations are called **methods**. The return values and side effects of a method can depend upon and change other attributes of the object. For example, `deposit` is a method of our `Account` object a. It takes one argument, the amount to deposit, changes the `balance` attribute of the object, and returns the resulting balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a.deposit(15)\n",
    "15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that **methods** are **invoked** on a particular object. As a result of invoking the `withdraw` method, either the withdrawal is approved and the amount is deducted, or the request is declined and the method returns an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a.withdraw(10)  # The withdraw method returns the balance after withdrawal\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>> a.balance       # The balance attribute has changed\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>> a.withdraw(10)\n",
    "'Insufficient funds'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated above, the behavior of a method can depend upon the changing attributes of the object. Two calls to `withdraw` with the same argument return different results."

    "## Defining Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined classes are created by class statements, which consist of a single clause. A class statement defines the class name, then includes a suite of statements to define the attributes of the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class <name>:\n",
    "    <suite>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class statement is executed, a new class is created and bound to `<name>` in the first frame of the current environment. The suite is then executed. Any names bound within the `<suite>` of a `class` statement, through `def` or assignment statements, create or modify attributes of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are typically organized around manipulating instance attributes, which are the name-value pairs associated with each instance of that class. The class specifies the instance attributes of its objects by defining a method for initializing new objects. For example, part of initializing an object of the `Account` class is to assign it a starting balance of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<suite>` of a `class` statement contains def statements that define new methods for objects of that class. The method that initializes objects has a special name in Python, `__init__` (two underscores on each side of the word \"init\"), and is called the constructor for the class."

    "The constructor binds the instance attribute name balance to 0. It also binds the attribute name holder to the value of the name account_holder.

    "## Message Passing and Dot Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods, which are defined in classes, and instance attributes, which are typically assigned in constructors, are the fundamental elements of object-oriented programming. These two concepts replicate much of the behavior of a dispatch dictionary in a message passing implementation of a data value. Objects take messages using dot notation, but instead of those messages being arbitrary string-valued keys, they are names local to a class. Objects also have named local state values (the instance attributes), but that state can be accessed and manipulated using dot notation, without having to employ nonlocal statements in the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central idea in message passing was that data values should have behavior by responding to messages that are relevant to the abstract type they represent. Dot notation is a syntactic feature of Python that formalizes the message passing metaphor. The advantage of using a language with a built-in object system is that message passing can interact seamlessly with other language features, such as assignment statements. We do not require different messages to \"get\" or \"set\" the value associated with a local attribute name; the language syntax allows us to use the message name directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dot expressions**. The code fragment `spock_account.deposit` is called a dot expression. A dot expression consists of an expression, a dot, and a name:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<expression> . <name>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<expression>` can be any valid Python expression, but the `<name>` must be a simple name (not an expression that evaluates to a name). A dot expression evaluates to the value of the attribute with the given `<name>`, for the object that is the value of the `<expression>`.\n",
    "\n",
