    "## Multiple Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction barriers allow us to separate the use and representation of data. However, in large programs, it may not always make sense to speak of \"the underlying representation\" for a data type in a program. For one thing, there might be more than one useful representation for a data object, and we might like to design systems that can deal with multiple representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To take a simple example, complex numbers may be represented in two almost equivalent ways: in rectangular form (real and imaginary parts) and in polar form (magnitude and angle). Sometimes the rectangular form is more appropriate and sometimes the polar form is more appropriate. Indeed, it is perfectly plausible to imagine a system in which complex numbers are represented in both ways, and in which the functions for manipulating complex numbers work with either representation. We implement such a system below. As a side note, we are developing a system that performs arithmetic operations on complex numbers as a simple but unrealistic example of a program that uses generic operations. A complex number type is actually built into Python, but for this example we will implement our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of allowing for multiple representations of data arises regularly. Large software systems are often designed by many people working over extended periods of time, subject to requirements that change over time. In such an environment, it is simply not possible for everyone to agree in advance on choices of data representation. In addition to the data-abstraction barriers that isolate representation from use, we need abstraction barriers that isolate different design choices from each other and permit different choices to coexist in a single program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin our implementation at the highest level of abstraction and work towards concrete representations. A `Complex` number is a `Number`, and numbers can be added or multiplied together. How numbers can be added or multiplied is abstracted by the method names `add` and `mul`.\n"

The purpose of `Number` is not to be instantiated directly, but instead to serve as a superclass of various specific number classes. Our next task is to define add and mul appropriately for complex numbers.\n",

    "A complex number can be thought of as a point in two-dimensional space with two orthogonal axes, the real axis and the imaginary axis. From this perspective, the complex number c = real + imag _ i (where i _ i = -1) can be thought of as the point in the plane whose horizontal coordinate is real and whose vertical coordinate is imag. Adding complex numbers involves adding their respective real and imag coordinates.\n",

A shared set of messages that elicit similar behavior from different classes is a powerful method of abstraction. An interface is a set of shared attribute names, along with a specification of their behavior. In the case of complex numbers, the interface needed to implement arithmetic consists of four attributes: `real, imag, magnitude, and angle`.\n",

    "For complex arithmetic to be correct, these attributes must be consistent. That is, the rectangular coordinates (`real`, `imag`) and the polar coordinates (`magnitude`, `angle`) must describe the same point on the complex plane.

The class for each representation can be developed separately; they must only agree on the names of the attributes they share, as well as any behavior conditions for those attributes.

Using data abstraction, we were able to change the implementation of a data type without changing the meaning of the program.

In both cases, a set of names and corresponding behavior conditions define the abstraction that enables this flexibility.\n",

Fortunately, we can sometimes do better by taking advantage of additional structure that may be latent in our type system. Often the different data types are not completely independent, and there may be ways by which objects of one type may be viewed as being of another type. This process is called coercion. For example, if we are asked to arithmetically combine a rational number with a complex number, we can view the rational number as a complex number whose imaginary part is zero. After doing so, we can use Complex.add and Complex.mul to combine them.\n",

    "This coercion scheme has some advantages over the method of defining explicit cross-type operations. Although we still need to write coercion functions to relate the types, we need to write only one function for each pair of types rather than a different function for each set of types and each generic operation. What we are counting on here is the fact that the appropriate transformation between types depends only on the types themselves, not on the particular operation to be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further advantages come from extending coercion. Some more sophisticated coercion schemes do not just try to coerce one type into another, but instead may try to coerce two different types each into a third common type. Consider a rhombus and a rectangle: neither is a special case of the other, but both can be viewed as quadrilaterals. Another extension to coercion is iterative coercion, in which one data type is coerced into another via intermediate types. Consider that an integer can be converted into a real number by first converting it into a rational number, then converting that rational number into a real number. Chaining coercion in this way can reduce the total number of coercion functions that are required by a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its advantages, coercion does have potential drawbacks. For one, coercion functions can lose information when they are applied. In our example, rational numbers are exact representations, but become approximations when they are converted to complex numbers."
